# Simple demo to demonstrate multiple inheritance in JOPA
This is a simple Spring application, that enables CRUD operations over few entities.

There are two separate hierarchies, demonstrating two different inheritance strategies.

In first example a simpler hierarchy is used, where class AudioBook is a subclass of both Book and Recording.
Both parent independently declare a single property that equals in name and RDF properties.

In second example a typical diamond hierarchy is used. This means a child class, Copier,
inherits from two parents, Scanner and Printer, which share a common ancestor - class Device.

Purpose of this repository is to demonstrate JOPAs ability to correctly handle operations over these hierarchies.
